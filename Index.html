      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>EcoBrew Coffee Co. was founded in 2015 in the beautiful town of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire by Makenzie Kavanagh. Inspired by summers spent on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, Makenzie saw firsthand the importance of protecting our natural bodies of water and surrounding environment. What began as a single coffee stand with a mission to reduce waste has grown into a company dedicated to sustainability. From compostable cups to shoreline cleanups, EcoBrew is built on the belief that great coffee can support a cleaner planet, both on land and in our lakes.</p>
